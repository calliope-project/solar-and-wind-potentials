# Code and data

The code and reproducible workflow used to perform this analysis is available online [@Trondle:2019b]. Furthermore, the resulting data is available online as well [@Trondle:2019a].

# Spatial and spatio-temporal data sources

Table @tbl:data-sources lists all spatial and spatio-temporal data sources used in this study, together with their most important technical characteristics and their source.

# Roofs for PV

Table @tbl:roof-statistics shows the share of roof categories from the sonnendach.ch dataset, which we assume to be representative for all countries in our study and which we thus use Europe-wide.

# Land eligibility

Figures @fig:exclusion-layers-alb -- @fig:exclusion-layers-gbr show the exclusion criteria land cover and use, slope, environmental protection, and urban settlements for all countries in our study. The exclusion criteria determine which parts of the land cannot be used for renewable electricity generation. The figures show the criteria for wind power --- open-field photovoltaics is more restricted than wind power in the criteria land cover and use as well as slope.

# Technical potential

Based on the input data, we determine the technical potential of renewable electricity for all Europe, all countries, all regions, and all municipalities in Europe. Table @tbl:technical-potential-national shows the technical potential for all countries in Europe. This data, and data on the continental, regional, and municipal levels is available for download, see above.

# Technical-social potential

Based on the input data, we determine the technical-social potential of renewable electricity for all Europe, all countries, all regions, and all municipalities in Europe. Table @tbl:technical-social-potential-national shows the technical-social potential for all countries in Europe. This data, and data on the continental, regional, and municipal levels is available for download, see above.
